Weather Statistics critical thinking:

    Program Requirements:
        -Array of 12 Structs to hold weather data for entire year
            Each month holds:
                Total Rainfall
                High Temp
                Low Temp
                Avg Temp    
                
        -User enters data for each month.
        
        -avgMonthlyTemps should be calculated
        
        -ONLY AFTER DATA IS ENTERED FOR ALL MONTHS following should be calculated:
            avgMonthlyRainfall
            totalYearRainfall
            highestAndLowest temps (and the months they occurred in)
            and the average of all the avgMonthlyTemps
            ****Input validation for temps between -100 & +140 degrees Fahrenheit.


    First Thoughts:
        Since I am required to use structs, then have those structs in an array I should be using pass-by-pointers to change the information in the array.All calculations should follow as normal (adding the numbers and dividing by the number of days inputted.) EXCEPT for the avgMonthlyTemps; that should be calculated as the user is inputting them. 

    Actual Steps Needed:
        0.) At the top of the paper goes my name--with the date!
        1.) Declare an arrayOfStructs[12]
        2.) Make, or reuse, function that allows user input to edit the array.
        3.) The above ^ function should nest. Outer loop is months, and inner loop is days.
        4.) Each inner loop iteration should calc the avgMonthlyTemps
        5.) Make functions that do necessary calculations AND output the data.
